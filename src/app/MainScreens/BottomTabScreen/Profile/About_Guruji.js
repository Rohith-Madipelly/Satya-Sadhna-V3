                            On the insistence of followers, he journeyed to foreign countries in the year 1975. He has been to Thailand, Hong Kong, Japan, the United States of America, Canada and England, etc. His simple explanation of the deep and complicated philosophical thoughts was easily understood and highly valued by the people in those countries. In the Jain society, Bara Upasara has its own importance, and Jains around the world are aware of its importance. Bara Upasara is famous for one of the traditions in Jain culture known as 'Khatargacha' and has its own honor and respect in the Jain society. Satya Sadhna is the identity of Bara Upasara. Paryushana is even celebrated by practicing Satya Sadhna, the way it should actually be practiced. Bara Upasara is as an ideal place for Satya Sadhna. From ten-day courses and one-day courses to courses for children (Bal Shivir), Bara Upasara is bustling with activities.
