                                When the mind starts experiencing the truth of one self – its starts to understand the reality of the world within us. It starts living in the present moment with equanimity.
                                With the practice of Satya Sadhna Meditation we bring happiness, peace and balance in our lives. We don’t get affected by the situations and circumstances around us for e.g we don’t loose our balance in every unpleasant situation on the contrary we face it with bravery. And when we have a favourable situation we enjoy it remaining in equanimity.
                                Satya Sadhna gives us happiness and peace. The knowledge gained by practicing Satya Sadhna is the knowledge of the sub conscious mind and it goes on improving the condition of our sub conscious and leads us to enlightenment.
                                Satya Sadhna makes us NIRBHAY, NIRVAR, NIRLEP.
